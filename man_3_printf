.SH DESCRIPTION

The _printf function (which derives its name from "print formatted") prints a message on the screen using a "format string" that includes the instructions to mix multiple strings into the final string to display on the screen.
.SH RETURN VALUE

The _printf function returns the number of characters written. If it returns a negative value it indicates that an error has occurred.
.SH FORMAT OF THE FUNCTION

The symbol "%" denotes the beginning of the format mark. Every brand, therefore, begins with the symbol "%" and ends with its type. Each of the names (parameter, flags, width, precision, length, and type) represents a set of possible values that are explained below. Example:
.IP
.B _printf("The value is %d.", counter);
.IP
.B The %d mark is replaced by the value of the variable counter and the resulting string is printed.
